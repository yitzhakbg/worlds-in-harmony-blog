The RoboGarden is a self contained, Arduino powered, indoor garden system that will take care of your plants. I started the project because I wasn't a very good gardener but I could build things that could be!

The project is open source and [all the files can be found on Github](https://github.com/yitzhakbg/neverstopbuilding/robo-garden).
