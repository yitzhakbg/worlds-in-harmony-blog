Mankind's progress surges upward from 1948, in-sync with Israel's rising from the ashes, ingathering to the rejuvenated land, creating a modern state. Some say incredulous. Out of the ordinary to say the least. The next dimension is the result of computing.

Lacking a visualization, it can be grasped by opening a wide time vision field. By extrapolating the continuation of those processes into the future they appear as early stages in an unfolding, ascending movement filling the world with wisdom and spirit through expanding virtuality. Hard to discern of divine light at this premature stage in which infused intelligence seems profane, sometimes even polluted. Yet the wisdom radiated by the virtual world elevates in time with humanity's continued advancement.

Spirituality, stereotypically ringing with a religion tone, is considered ethereal, beyond our facilities and beyond physical dimensions. Jewish thought and practice is planted in harmonious elevation of the material world through the nation's deeds in every aspect of life. That could hardly transpire through the millenia of Israel's exile. Dismembered from the land, Israel languished as a nation in coma. The last remaining strands of attachment to their land withered into the suffocating confines of religion, lit within by the glowing ember of Torah which sustained a spark of national vitality in the face of constantly impending extermination. Aspirations to elevate the material world through deeds drifted into an oblivious dream of the past. Humanity stagnated as the spiritual world was in exile with Israel, severed from the material world.

Israel's reattachment to the material world in the Land of Israel uplifts humanity. Emergence of virtuality is an embryonic stage in closing the rift between the material and spiritual worlds, leading to an entirely virtual, entirely real world, ablaze with the light of Torah borne by the Nation of Israel.
